# ci-cd-github-actions

This repo is where I followed **codedamn's** CI/CD With GitHub Actions course (https://codedamn.com/learn/github-actions-ci-cd).

The course taught me valuable concepts to create and leverage Github Actions pipelines, from building to deploying and testing applications automatically.

The key concepts addressed were:
<ul>
  <li> YAML syntax and configuration </li>
  <li> Creating Github Workflows </li>
  <li> Building the local environment remotely </li>
  <li> Deploying a template React app to Vercel automatically </li>
    <ul>
        <li> Setting up Prodution Secrets using Github Environment Variables </li>        
    </ul>
  <li> Creating a Mock Testing job dependent on the build </li>
    <ul>
        <li> Sharing data between the Build and Testing jobs </li>       
    </ul>
  
</ul>
